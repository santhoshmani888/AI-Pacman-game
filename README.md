Artificial Intelligence, Pacman Game 

The Pacman Projects by the University of California, Berkeley.

In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Try to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

Pacman search algorithms for:
1.DFS, BFS, UCS, ASTAR, ASTAR heuristic
2.Corner problem, Corner heuristic
3.Eating all the dots
